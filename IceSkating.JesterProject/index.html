        <span>While this project will mainly focus on Speed Skating, I still need a lot of fluff so we're gonna talk
          about skating in general. There are a few types of ice skating, these are the main ones</span>

        <h3>Differences</h3>
        <p>
          Each one in their own does use ice skating as the basis of their sport <em>duh</em>, but each one uses it
          differently.
          Take <strong>Fen Skating</strong> for example, its the most traditional out of the listed above, dating back
          to
          the medieval times.
          <strong>Fen Skating</strong>, instead of using a rink or designated area for skating, used the towns it was
          played in as the skating ring.
          The cities in which Fen Skating was popular, got so cold that they could literally <em>skate</em> on the
          ground.
          Of course, it didn't hurt that
          where Fen Skating was popular, the lands were flat.

        <h3>Speed Skating</h3>
        <img class="fl small" src="assets/images/SpeedSkating.jpg" alt="Speed Skating Image" />
        <p>
          <strong>Speed Skating</strong> just <em>slightly</em> more modern than <strong>Fen Skating</strong> focuses
          more on speed than having fun.
          So now you can call people faster than you at skating <strong>Try Hards</strong>. This sport is purely
          competitive, prioritizing speed more than anything.
          Sometimes, people can reach up to 60 MPH, thats the average speed of your grandmother driving on I-64. That
          poor poor grandmother... Hope she took her pills today.
        </p>

        <p>
          Could you imagine that? imagine traveling <strong><em>60 MPH</em></strong>, with no car, no bike no nothing.
          No protection, only you, a very tight spandex and courage. For reference
          the average human runs at <strong>~7 MPH</strong> that means that those people speed skating are going about
          <strong>10X as fast</strong> as you running. Now I don't know about you,
          I wouldn't be able to do it. I mean I can barely skate normally let alone on ice that fast. Thankfully, there
          are a few things you could do <em>If you're a maniac who decides to ice skate... fast</em> to not fall on your
          bum whenever
          you decide to give change a french kiss, and thehse thigns can be boiled down to a few simple steps
        </p>
        <p>Here they are in all their glory:</p>
        <ol>
          <li>Position yourself</li>
          <li>Push</li>
          <li>Bend Knees</li>
          <li>Don't Fall</li>
          <li>Repeat</li>
        </ol>

        <h3>Why I like Speed Skating</h3>

        <p>
          Even though speed skating is something I never really thought about until exactly <strong>2 days ago</strong>,
          it
          will always hold a special place in whatever the beating thing in my chest is.

        <ol type="i">
          <li>Its an adrenaline junkie magnet</li>
          <li>The sole purpose is to go fast</li>
          <li>It requires an incredible amount of skill</li>
          <li>Quite of bit of money in the industry</li>
        </ol>
